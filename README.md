# Tokyo Olympic Summer Games

This project is designed for learning data visualization using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains information from the Tokyo Summer Olympics 2020, downloaded in CSV format for easy data manipulation.

## Purpose
The primary objective is to leverage the Python library Matplotlib for data visualization. While initially encountering challenges with Pandas, I opted to utilize the CSV library to efficiently manage input from the CSV file and organize it for subsequent plotting.

## Exploring Relationships
Efforts were made to establish meaningful relationships within the data, facilitating visualization for a better understanding of the Tokyo Summer Games.

An interesting observation is that although the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) has won considerably more silver medals than Japan (ROC = 28, Japan = 14), Japan has claimed significantly more gold medals. The USA displays a balanced distribution with 39 Gold Medals, 41 Silver Medals, and 33 Bronze Medals.

Further reducing the minimum number of participants reveals an even wider array of sports:
