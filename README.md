# Tokyo Olympic Summer Games 

Project for learning Data visualizion using a Dataset from Keggle.

This includs Data from the Tokyo Summer Olympics 2020, which is downloaded and used as a csv file format so that you can easlie read every input and store it into lists for later ploting. 
For this purpose I chose to learn more about the used python libary matplotlib as well as pandas.

Running trough some problems when working with pandas I decided to just use the csv Libary to take the input from the csv file and sort it for my specific use. 

Trying to set Data into usefull relationship so that you actually vizualize it results into getting a basic understanding and information about the Summer Games. 


For example what are the catoggersy with most participants :
