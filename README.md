# Tokyo Olympic Summer Games 

Project for learning Data visualization using a Dataset from Kaggle.

This includes Data from the Tokyo Summer Olympics 2020, which is downloaded and used as a CSV file format so that you can easily read every input and store it into lists for later plotting. 
For this purpose, I chose to learn more about the used python library matplotlib. 

Running through some problems when working with pandas I decided to just use the CSV Libary to take the input from the CSV file and sort it for my specific use. 

Trying to set Data into a useful relationship so that you can visualize the results to get a basic understanding and information about the Games. 


For example, which are the categories with most participants :

And also which country has the won the most medals in total, most Gold Medals as well as most Silver Medals and most Bronze medals. 
The following images show a quick comparison between countries in terms of Medals won.

Interestingly you can see that even though ROC(Russian Olympic Committee) has won far more silver medals than Japan(ROC = 28, Japan=14), Japan still has won a lot more gold medals. 

Also, the USA has a very even spread with 39 Gold Medals, 41 Silver Medals, and 33 Bronze Medals.

If you take a specific country, what is its „favorite“ and most popular sport?

Tested for Germany, Greece, USA, Norway, Brazil:

Intrestgliny enough there are very few Sports in Germany which have a high amount of participants. Therefore there is a very bright spectrum of all kinds of sports.

By reducing the minimum amount of participants even furgterm, we get an even vaster spread of Sports:
