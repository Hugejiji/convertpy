# Tokyo Olympic Summer Games

This project focuses on learning data visualization using a dataset from Kaggle, specifically data from the Tokyo Summer Olympics 2020. The dataset is downloaded and utilized in CSV file format, making it easy to read every input and store it into lists for later plotting. For this purpose, I opted to learn more about the Python library Matplotlib.

Encountering some challenges while working with Pandas, I decided to use the CSV Library to extract input from the CSV file and organize it for my specific needs.

The goal is to visualize the results using the python libaries matplotlib and pandas and gain a basic understanding and insights into the Games.
